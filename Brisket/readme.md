# Brisket

### Brisket is one of the toughest pieces of meat that comes from a cow. To combat this, slow cooking over many hours will break down the connective tissue creating a tender flavorful piece of meat that is as rewarding as the time it takes to prepare it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisket


### Preparation
The first step with any brisket is to prepare it for smoking. Unless you receive your brisket pre-trimmmed you have some work to do before you can even put it in the smoker. This entire process may take up to 24 hours to complete, so its well advised to start this process well in advance of your serving window.

### Trimming guide
* The goal with trimming your brisket is the following:
    * Remove thinner parts of the meat that will dry out during smoking
    * Make the meat aeroydynamic so that smoke flows smoothly across the surface
    * Remove excess fat that will not render (dont trim the fat cap too thin!)

* PRO TIP - You will have an easier time trimming your brisket if the meat is still partially frozen. Consider keeping your brisket in the freezer for up to 2 hours before trimming.

### Seasoning & Spices
Seasoning a brisket is important to getting a great bark (the spicy crust that forms on the outside of the meet from slow cooking). 

1. Pat the meat as dry as possible 
1. Let the meat rest uncovered for 1 hours at room tempurature. This allows the surface of the meat to become tacky so that the seasoning sticks without needing a binder such as mustard or hot sauce.
    1. If you chose to use a binder, you can skip this wait period and apply your favorite mustard or hot sauce. 
1. Pat dry once again, you should see the paper towel having slight resistence when pulling from the meat.
1. Apply your favorite seasoning to the bottom first, then the fat cap, and dont go too thin (Typically the more coarse grind the better).
1. Let rest for one more hour at room temp to really make sure the seasoning sticks. While this is going, you can start getting your smoker up to temp.

* ### Smoking
You will first need to evaluate your smoker for the optimal brisket placement. 
1. Identify where the fire plate//heat source is. Once you have determiend that location, fill an aluminum tray with water and place it on the grill directly over that spot. 
    * This serves multiple purposes:
        * Prevents direct heat from burning the bottom of the brisket
        * Humidifies the smoker as an effort to prevent drying out
1. Set your smoker to the appropriate temp. If you are using a traditional offset, start between 250-275. For a modern pellet smoker, its recommended to start a little bit lower at 225.
1. Place your brisket in the smoker with the thin part (the flat) facing the opposite direction of the heat source. The flat can easily be burned and dried out if not monitored.
1. Insert your probe to the thickest part of the meat
1. Smoke the brisket until the temp reaches 160 degrees fahrenheit.  Every 2 hours, spray the brisket lightly with a 50/50 mix of apple cider vinegar and water. Dont make the brisket soaking wet, just enough to give it a glistening look.
1. When you hit 160, this is typically where the brisket can stall and temperature will not continue to rise without help.
    1. If you are in a rush, you can wrap the brisket in foil https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ldg73DumjI
    1. If you want to maximize smoke flavor and bark you can use a foil boat https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YytF06_1bxs
1. Once wrapped and returned back to the smoker, re-insert the probes and set the temp to 250. Your in the final phase now!
1. Monitor the brisket until the internal temperature reatures 201 degrees. At this point, you will need to test the brisket to see how rendered the fat is. If you can push your finger into the fat cap without resistance, it is ready to be removed. If the fat cap still shows resistance, keep smoking until you can.

### The rest
Its absolutely critical you let the brisket rest after removing it from the smoker. When the meat cools down, it begins to draw the juices and spices from the bark infusing the meat with flavor. The longer the rest, the better.

1. Wrap the brisket in butcher paper or foil. If you have an excess of juice in your foil boat, drain some of it, but keep enough so the bottom of the meat is still covered in it.
1. Place the brisket into a cooler, and let sit for 2-4 hours so it can come to serving temp slowly.


### Serving
Brisket is a fibrous meat, and even after all this slow smoking it can still have some toughness to it, but that can be fixed by ensuring you cut against the grain. See this article here for more info https://www.traeger.com/learn/how-to-slice-brisket
